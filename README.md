🚀 Usage

Run the script:

python qr_generator.py

You will be asked for:

1. Text / URL for QR code.


2. First and second gradient colors (e.g., navy, #0000ff, #ff5733).


3. Shape choice: square, rounded_square, circle, diamond, hexagon.


4. Path to background image (cropped automatically).

📂 Output

The script saves the final composite image as:

final_qr_composite.png

The result looks like:

Gradient-colored QR

Centered on a 9:16 background

Logo placed safely inside QR

Optional header image above QR

⚠️ Notes

Use high-contrast gradients (darker colors work better for scanning).

Keep logos small (20–25% of QR size max).

If the header image overlaps, script automatically adjusts position.

Use the required images for your own use
